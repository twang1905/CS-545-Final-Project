        QuickLearn Flashcards is a website application that college students can
        utilize in order to study for their classes and learn new concepts in a
        timely manner. It will include a way for the user to create, name, and
        manage flashcard sets that can be used in a variety of ways to reinforce
        material they learned in class, such as matching terms and descriptions.
        While the user studies with the flashcards, they can rate their
        confidence for each card which will impact how often the card is shown
        again. Rating a high confidence level on a card will show it less often,
        while a low confidence level will make it appear more often to give the
        user more practice. A score will keep track of the studentâ€™s confidence
        with flashcards set, and once they receive a high enough score they can
        choose to take a test on all of the flashcards.
